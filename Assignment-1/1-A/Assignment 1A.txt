Assignment 1-A

1st code :

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a,b,c;

    a = 5; 
    b = 3;

/*  printf(" Give a : \n");
    scanf(" %d", &a);

    printf(" Give b : \n");
    scanf(" %d", &b); 

     c = a; 
     a = b;
     b = c;

*/

    c = a + b - b;
    a = b;
    b = c;


    printf(" a = %d  \n b = %d \n After swapping : \n a = %d \n b = %d ", a,b,b,a); 

    return 0;

}



2nd code :

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int speed, distance, time;

    speed = 5; 
    time = 3;

/*  printf(" Please mention the speed of the vehicle (kmph) :  \n");
    scanf(" %d", &speed);

    printf("Please mention the time duration of the journey (hrs): \n");
    scanf(" %d", &b);   
    
*/

    distance = speed * time;

    printf(" In %dhrs, a vehicle travelling at %dkmph covers %dkm ", time, speed, distance); 

    return 0;

}
